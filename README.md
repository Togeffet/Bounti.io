# Bounti.io
Bounti.io is a full stack web application that I developed in the free time I had during my freshman year of college.

It was deployed on a Linux server using Amazon Web Services, but the free tier year ran out and it started costing
too much to host it there. When I get less busy I'm going to go in and clean up the code and document everything, just so it isn't 
wasting away here and maybe someone can benefit from it.

In the future, I'd also love to see if I can have a version of this running on a smaller EC2 instance (linux server in AWS) just so
it can be demoed for anyone that wants to see my work.

If you want to see what it all looks like, email franklin.fanelli@bounti.io and I'll start up the server that it was on for you!
