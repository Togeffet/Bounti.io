    <h1>Bounti.io Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Bounti.io takes privacy seriously, and only collects information that is required.
      The collected personally identifiable information includes what is provided while creating an account (email address, full name, date of birth, etc.),
      the IP address used at the time of the account creation, and any bank accounts, credit cards, and/or debit cards provided at the
      users' will. Choosing to not provide this information may limit the access the user has to this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bounti.io keeps only the personally identifiable information given at the time of account creation and keeps it updated with
      any changes made to the account in the settings page of the website. The user is able to view or change any of this information
      at any time by going to the <a href="https://www.bounti.io/settings">settings</a> or <a href="https://www.bounti.io/managepaymentmethods">manage payment methods</a> pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only information that Bounti.io does not keep is any payment methods provided to us. It is sent directly and securely to
      our payment provider, Stripe. We also share some of the personally identifiable information provided during the account creation
      process, strictly for the use of verification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bounti.io reserves the right to change the privacy policy at any time, and at its sole discretion. Bounti.io recommends that users
      check this page often, to witness any changes made. Your continued use of this website will constitute your agreement to this privacy policy.
